Hi, I'm Vitor.
I'm on my way to becoming a great website programmer!
I'm Brazilian, but specifically I'm from Fortaleza-CÃ©ara.
I'm interested in doing a lot of projects, if you want to start any projects with me, contact me on Discord: Mido#6955.
I also managed to learn advanced Python, but as I said, today I'm studying HTML site development, CSS and Javascript.
I'm still very young, but as they say: "There is no age to learn to program."

My story of how I got into the programming world is quite complex and confusing.
I got into programming through a Bot, called NightBot.
It is a Twitch Bot that serves to help streamers moderate the chat.
So I went to see a Twitch channel and saw this Bot. I got interested and learned some commands he had.
His commands were in JavaScript, I didn't know anything about programming, so I went to see a little is, I fell in love...
That's how I went from being a boy watching stream to being a programmer.
